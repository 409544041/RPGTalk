# RPGTalk
Repository for the Unity's RPGTalk asset. Let's help each other out!

#### If you only want the asset, be sure to check The [Asset Store](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/73392)

This package allows the creation of dialogs very RPG-Like, with smoothly text show-ups and a lot of useful configuration.
It easily transforms .TXT files in dialogs in your scene. You can use sprites in the middle of the text, make questions and giving choices to the player, change language, have dubbing(voice over) and so much more!

Oh, did I mention it is free!?

RPGTalk is free to use and its code is opensource. But it isn't perfect. If you need to make changes, why don't you contribute to other users as well?
That is why this GIT was created. Fork it, make a Pull Request, let's make an awesome dialog system together!

This asset is only free because of the amazing guys at Seize Studios. Be sure to show your support by following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seizestudios) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/seizestudios).
